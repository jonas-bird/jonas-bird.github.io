## **Currently working on:**

Getting good at programming.
Spending too much time on [Hack the box](https://hackthebox.eu)
Continuing to improve my coding and network automation skills.  
Finding an IT job in New York City

#### [Learning Go](https://github.com/jonas-bird/learning-go) 
I have started learning Go (or Golang if you prefer). This repo is me coding along (free time project that I can only put a few hours a week into) with [Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/go-fundamentals/hello-world) by Chris James. I have also been moving along the Go track on [exercisim.io](https://exercism.org/profiles/jonas-bird)

## **Past projects** 

### Python 

#### [Rock Paper Scissors Game](https://github.com/jonas-bird/IPnD-Python-RockPaperScissors)

I am fairly sure it is mandatory that any introductory programming course have a game of rock, paper, scissors as an assignment. This version includes a couple of patterns for the computer player to select from randomly 

#### [Google IT Automation with Python, final project](https://github.com/jonas-bird/Google-IT-Automation-with-Python-Final-Project)
This is the code I wrote for the final lab of Google's IT Automation With Python capstone module "Automating Real-World Tasks with Python"
This is an example of a script that was put together under time pressure to get 'good-enough' results.

#### [Google IT Automation with Python, Image Manipulation](https://github.com/jonas-bird/Real-World-Python-Images)
This project makes use of the Python Imaging Library to perform some common image manipulation tasks (rotate, resize, change format) on a folder of images


### **HTML / CSS** 

An IT professional must be able to support web-based applications as well as traditional web-pages. I think it is important to understand the skills used to create them, as well as maintain them.   

#### [Animal Trading Cards](https://jonas-bird.github.io/accenture-itpnd-animal-card/)

One of the earlier projects in the Intro to Programming nano-Degree I completed through Udacity. View the [code](https://jonas-bird.github.io/accenture-itpnd-animal-card/) repository on GitHub 


#### [Pixel Art Maker](https://jonas-bird.github.io/Udacity-IPnD-PixelArt/)

My version of the common introductory JavaScript project. [Code](https://jonas-bird.github.io/Udacity-IPnD-PixelArt/) is available on GitHub 

### **Writing** 

#### [SEO Copy: Estate Millworks](https://jonas-bird.github.io/writing-portfolio/)

While going through some old backups I came across some copy I wrote quite a long time ago. While I don't plan on working directly in marketing/SEO, being able to communicate effectively is an important skill for a technology professional, so I thought it should be included here.
