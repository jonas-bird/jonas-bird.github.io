# Window Shutters: Beauty meets tradition

test test test
Did you know that window shutters have been decorative favorites for centuries? It’s true. The first window
shutters in human history allegedly date back to ancient Greece and Rome. However, it was during the Lafayette
period of American architecture that window shutters took off as magnificent architectural enhancements. Since
then, window shutters have been installed on homes, buildings, and condominiums of all styles and sizes. In
Philadelphia and Baltimore, board-and-batten window shutters look cheery on city brick rowhomes. In the sunny
Southeast, plantation and louvered window shutters complement the stately mansions of Atlanta and Charleston.
In bohemian San Francisco and Pittsburgh’s hipster East End, natty louvered window shutters stand smart on
Victorian houses. In coastal cities across the world, window shutters offer protection from hurricanes, pounding
rains, and whipping winds. And they offer homeowners privacy, sound-dampening, and savings on their energy bills.
Indeed, window shutters are magnificent creations.  

## Estate Millwork window shutters: We bring the value and beauty to you  

Estate Millwork window shutters are artisan-crafted by experts who have studied the art of shutter-making for years. 
Each window shutter we sell is assembled using genuine wood joinery, and is created strictly from top-grade 
hardwoods.  

  The hardwood we use in our window shutters is always free from mars, blemishes, and pockmarks. Each piece is cut
from a sustainable-harvest forest, and is milled to the nearest one-eight inch for a precise fit. Our careful 
craftsmanship means less wood waste – and more value for you. Moreover, our window shutters are assembled to 
last for decades with very little upkeep.  

  The dense, solid hardwood in our window shutters has a high R-value (R-value is defined as “an object’s 
resistance to heat transfer”). This is good news for you; high R-value wood is more resistant to heat flow than 
inferior building materials like particle board or vinyl. Our window shutters keep the cold out of your home, 
and enhance the efficiency of your home heating and cooling systems.
