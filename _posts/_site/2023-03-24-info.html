<h2 id="why-am-i-writing">Why am I writing?</h2>
<p>Because I forgot to type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sed -n 's/unemployed/network admin/' my_life-2023'</code></p>

<p>Hopefully this blog will help me make use of the time I spend preparing for a job by improving my skills (something that is fun) towards reducing the amount of time I spend looking at job listings and sending in resumes (not fun) Perhaps it  will provide practice in documenting and writing about technical solutions. I also hope that it will help potential employers get a better feel for who I am and my skills so that I end up in the right job:</p>

<p>I am a former Computer/TV/anything electronic repair guy who moved to New York, worked a few different office jobs, ended up with some health problems. While recovering I realized that I really like working with technology and that it was time to go back to what I love doing. Last year I finished Googleâ€™s IT Automation with Python certification, an Intro to Programming nano-degree from Udacity, earned a CCNA, and turned my long time hobby and desktop use of Linux into more focused homelab work.</p>

<p>This year I am on the job market. I have started going on interviews, and am hopeful that the right fit will come along soon. I am also continuing to build my skills. I focused mainly on Linux and networking last year. This year I intend to build on that (I am considering getting the RHCSA in the not too distant future) while also getting more in depth with Windows Server and Powershell than I have in the past. I also plan on moving from writing scripts to working on larger coding projects. Once I find a job my focus will probably change to include more of the tech I encounter at work, but for now this is where my interest lie.</p>
