<h1 id="i-installed-proxmox">I installed Proxmox…</h1>

<p>The installation went fairly smoothly, other than a ‘Layer 1 issue’ involving my head and my desk while plugging in the ethernet. I also ended up being a bit indecisive about my IP addressing scheme and needed to edit /etc/network/interfaces and /etc/hosts. So far so good. <br />

<h2 id="now-what">…now what?</h2>

<p>I have been considering getting the Red Hat Certified System Administrator as a required step towards the Kubernetes and OpenShift certifications Red Hat offers. That means spending some time with yum instead of Apt so I downloaded Alma Linux to start exploring. I ran into an issue with the default CPU choice - kvm64 (an abstraction designed to facilitate moving VMs between machines) Switching to using the machines CPU cleared up the issue. Luckily this is a known issue and didn’t take me long to figure out.</p>

<p>Playing around with the new install made me regret putting off setting up stow or some other way of quickly installing my dotfiles…</p>

<h2 id="containers-within-containers-within-containers">Containers within containers within containers….</h2>

<p>Since I know I am going to want to run Docker containers I have a bit more setup to do. Going by the Proxmox forums there are a few ways people do this. Having the Proxmox host run Docker directly seems like a bad idea, even though my janky little birdy lab is far from a production environment I agree. Since I am trying to keep within my memory budget just setting up a VM just to run application containers is counterproductive, though this is the approach that I thought of first and is the commonly recommended way of doing things.  So it seems like I need to find a LXC container to run my application containers.<br />
A few minutes on DDG and I came across <a href="https://www.turnkeylinux.org">TurnKey Linux</a> who used to offer a LXC container that includes a a collection of tools that might be useful. It turns out they even make a template available - that has not been updated in several years and no longer appears in the list of downloadable templates. There focus seems to be more on AWS right now so I will keep them in mind for when I am spending time on Amazon’s cloud.
I also found some instructions that informed me that feline based data recovery is not ready for production, but also had <a href="https://www.weisb.net/running-docker-in-lxc-with-proxmox-7-1/">Running Docker in LXC With Proxmox 7.1</a> looks simple (back when I was first getting into Linux you needed to patch your kernel by hand on punch cards uphill in the snow…) and in a few minutes everything is up and running. Almost anti-climactic.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The temptation is just to start fooling around and once I get something that works keep it until something goes wrong…. Luckily I plan to upgrade my hardware soon enough that I know I am going to need to redo this soon, so I am going to want to document everything with an eye towards writing a script or Ansible playbook for future installs…</p>
