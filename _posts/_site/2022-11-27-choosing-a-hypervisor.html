<h1 id="why-i-am-installing-proxmox">Why I am Installing Proxmox</h1>

<p>If you want a really simple answer it is because of Linux Containers. Right now I happen to be using a VERY old tower a neighbor was throwing out as my virtualization server. With only 8GB of RAM and a single Intel I5 from 2009, I need to be as efficient as possible, and Proxmox seemed like the way to go. Once I am working full time, and I upgrade my homelab, I would like to explore XCP-NG and possibly ESXi, but for now I want to see how much I can get out of what I have.</p>

<p>Some of the resources I am using to learn how to use Proxmox</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.learnlinux.tv/">Learn Linux TV</a> has been an excellent source of information and inspiration. The material Jay offers on Proxmox is a great starting point.</li>
  <li>Reading the manual is usually a good place to start. The <a href="https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/pve-admin-guide.html">Proxmox VE Admin Guide</a></li>
</ul>
