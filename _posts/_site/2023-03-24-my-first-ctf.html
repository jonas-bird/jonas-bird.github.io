<p>While I have been playing around on <a href="https://www.tryhackme.com">tryhackme.com</a> since Advent of Cyber 2022, my first competitive CTF has been <a href="https://www.hackthebox.com/blog/cyber-apocalypse-2023-news">Cyber Apocalypse 2023</a> - it has been a blast! While I only had a limited amount of time to dedicate to the CTF, I managed to accumulate enough points while getting a feel for things to bring my team (consisting of me) to 1417’th place. Since Hackthebox has been generous enough to keep the servers up a few more days, I am going to see if I can solve some of the challenges I overlooked or didn’t have time for during the competition. Going forward, I’m going to invest some time learning tools like BurpSuite and pwndbg so next time I can take on some of the harder challenges, and maybe even find a team to work with!</p>
