<p>I am trying to get ahead on my spring cleaning and went through the scrap I have left over to see if I can get any use out of it. Not show is an old P4 that is probably not that useful. The Mackbook Pro has a bad motherboard and I don’t have a re-flow station, or the free time at the moment. The box contains the remnants of a few Core2Duo Mackbooks that I am fairly sure worked… The only thing I am actually sure I am going to try and use is the Dell, it has a bad power supply and no memory. It does have a CPU that supports virtualization and is slightly newer that my current Proxmox box.</p>
