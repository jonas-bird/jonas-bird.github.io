# Why I am Installing Proxmox 

If you want a really simple answer it is because of Linux Containers. Right now I happen to be using a VERY old tower a neighbor was throwing out as my virtualization server. With only 8GB of RAM and a single Intel I5 from 2009, I need to be as efficient as possible, and Proxmox seemed like the way to go. Once I am working full time, and I upgrade my homelab, I would like to explore XCP-NG and possibly ESXi, but for now I want to see how much I can get out of what I have.   

Some of the resources I am using to learn how to use Proxmox
+ [Learn Linux TV](https://www.learnlinux.tv/) has been an excellent source of information and inspiration. The material Jay offers on Proxmox is a great starting point. 
+ Reading the manual is usually a good place to start. The [Proxmox VE Admin Guide](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/pve-admin-guide.html)
